<div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been working remotely for <a href="http://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> for 3
months now.</p>
<p>I decided to do this because I interviewed at this place, and the
people were thoughtful and friendly and interesting and knew things
that I did not know! But they were all in San Francisco, and I didn’t
want to move there at all. They convinced me that if I worked remote
it might not be a disaster.</p>
<p>I was still pretty scared about working remote, though! So far it’s
been hard, but I’m learning how to do it better. I’m somewhat
extroverted, so it’s possible for me to go a bit stir-crazy sitting
alone by myself all day.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I recently wrote an post called
<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/05/28/anonymous-talk-submission-equals-amazing/">Anonymous review is amazing</a>,
talking about our experience with anonymous review at
<a href="http://bangbangcon.com/">!!Con</a> (it was excellent! I was surprised
and delighted!). There was a discussion on the PyCon organizers list
today about whether PyCon should do anonymous review, and I started
thinking about this a little more carefully.</p>
<p>I’m going to make a few assumptions up front: our goal as conference
organizers is to have</p>
<ul>
<li>a process that is as unbiased as possible</li>
<li>speakers who will be engaging</li>
<li>who come from diverse backgrounds</li>
<li>where some are new speakers, and some are more experienced</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s talk about whether anonymous review will help us with these things!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Coming down from <a href="http://bangbangcon/">!!Con</a>, there are a lot of
things I want to talk about. One of the things that surprised and
delighted me the most was how well anonymous talk review worked. I
would like to tell you about this and how we structured our talk
review generally.</p>
<p>We decided to review all the talks anonymously, to try to reduce our
bias. This was a <em>ton</em> of work.
<a href="http://www.nullspace.io/">Alex Clemmer</a> personally anonymized all the
talk proposals and then sat out of the review process because he knew
the identities of the proposers. He did an amazing job (including
watching attached videos and summarizing them for the reviewers!).</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I wanted to start learning about how HDFS (the Hadoop
Distributed File System) works internally. I knew that</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s distributed, so one file may be stored across many different
machines</li>
<li>There’s a <em>namenode</em>, which keeps track of where all the files are
stored</li>
<li>There are <em>data nodes</em>, which contain the actual file data</li>
</ul>
<p>But I wasn’t quite sure how to get started! I knew how to navigate the
filesystem from the command line (<code>hadoop fs -ls /</code>, and friends), but
not how to figure out how it works internally.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I talked about using <code>perf</code> to profile assembly
instructions. Today I learned how to make flame graphs with <code>perf</code>
today and it is THE BEST. I found this because
<a href="https://twitter.com/graydon_moz">Graydon Hoare</a> pointed me to Brendan
Gregg’s <em>excellent</em>
<a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html">page on how to use perf</a>.</p>
<p>Wait up! What’s <code>perf</code>? I’ve talked about <code>strace</code> a lot before (in
<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/04/20/debug-your-programs-like-theyre-closed-source/">Debug your programs like they’re closed source</a>).
<code>strace</code> lets you see which system calls a program is calling. But
what if you wanted to know</p>
<ul>
<li>how many CPU instructions it ran?</li>
<li>How many L1 cache misses there were?</li>
<li>profiling information for each assembly instruction?</li>

<div class="entry-content"><p>So I have a computer. My computer contains hardware (like a CPU! RAM!
L1/L2 caches!) But I don’t understand very well how fast that hardware
is, what tools I have to profile it, and how much of the time that my
programs are running is split between RAM/the hard disk/the CPU.</p>
<p>So today I paired with
<a href="https://twitter.com/SashaLaundy">Sasha Laundy</a>, and we ran Serious
Investigations into how fast my computer can process a 1GB file.</p>
<p><strong>The objects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An episode of The Newsroom (1GB)</li>
<li>A task: add up all the bytes (mod 256)</li>
</ul>
<p>This was basically the easiest task that I could think of that
involved processing the entire file (so nothing gets optimized out by
the compiler).</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>A while ago I had a bug in my code. I was frustrated because I
couldn’t get into a debugger to get more information – I needed to
know more to understand what was going on! I went home, sad.</p>
<p>On my way back in the morning, I thought about the error message I’d
seen. I realized I didn’t need more information! What I had was
enough, and I knew how to fix it. I’d like to remember to step back
and think more often and more quickly.</p>

<p>I used to have this dialog with myself pretty often:</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, Julia, open source is good!</li>
<li>Yeah, I should go do some open source</li>
<li>What project? I don’t know. huh.</li>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Until very recently, if I was debugging a program, I practically
always did one of these three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>open a debugger</li>
<li>look at the source code</li>
<li>insert some print statements</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve started sometimes debugging a new way. With this method, I don’t
look at the source code, don’t edit the source code, and don’t use a
debugger. I don’t even need to have the program’s source available to
me!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>PyCon 2014 happened! It was my first time at PyCon, I expected to have
a good time, and it was better than I expected. I spoke! People came
up to me and said they enjoyed my talk! There were so many amazing
talks! I met so many people whose work I’d been following! 1/3 of the
talks were by women! It was <em>wonderful</em>.</p>

<p>A few talks that especially stood out to me, or that I missed and
<em>really</em> want to see. I didn’t see anything like all the talks, but I
liked these. In no particular order:</p>
